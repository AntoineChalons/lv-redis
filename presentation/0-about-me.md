## What is Redis

Redis (Remote Dictionary Server) is an open-source,
in-memory data structure store that functions as a database, cache, and message broker.
It's designed for high-speed data retrieval and manipulation, offering exceptional performance
by storing data in memory rather than on disk or SSD.

## Typical usage of Redis

- Caching: Improves application performance by storing frequently accessed data
- Session management: Handles user sessions across platforms
- Real-time analytics: Processes and analyzes data on the fly
- Message queuing: Acts as a reliable message broker for pub/sub systems
- Leaderboards and counters: Facilitates real-time scoring and ranking
- High-speed data ingestion: Handles vast amounts of data for real-time processing
- E-commerce applications: Powers personalization and recommendation engines
